## Hello, I'm Ciaran! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Software Developer who recently completed a Level 8 BSc in 'Games Design & Development'.  
Having completed this course, I now intend to pursue Software/Game Development as a career.  I am very interested in Computer Science (both hardware and software), and this is reflected in my work.
